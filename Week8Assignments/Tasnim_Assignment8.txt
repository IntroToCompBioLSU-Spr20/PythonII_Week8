#Since the individual moved the distance of 2.236068 in 10 days,and the individual moved equal distance every day, the individual moved the distance of 2.236068/10=0.2236068 each day.
#Distances from running the simulation couple of times:
1st attempt:2.236068
2nd attempt:3.162278
3rd attempt:1.414214
4th attempt:1.414214
5th attempt:2.236068
#From my perspective, it is hard to tell from the coordinates how much distance they can actually move as the model says they can only 
move a fixed distance each day. Therefore, the random model of movement cant explain well.For example, if the individuals coordinate 
is [1,1] and [1,3], according to the model it should be around a fixed distance each day but the coordinates doesn't show that it moved 
a fixed distance, instead it moved twice as much in upper direction in the next day which is contradictory to the model.
